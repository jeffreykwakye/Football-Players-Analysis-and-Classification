## Data Analysis of Football Player Attributes

## Project Overview: 
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive data analysis of football player attributes using Python and the Pandas library. 
The dataset, sourced from a Google Sheets link, contains detailed information about various football players, including their nationalities, ages, 
preferred positions, and specific skill ratings.

## Key Objectives:
1.	Data Loading and Inspection:
  o	Loaded the dataset from a Google Sheets link using Pandas.
  o	Inspected the dataset to understand its structure and identify key columns for analysis.
2.	Numpy and Pandas Proficiency:
  o	Demonstrated proficiency in using Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames for data manipulation and analysis.
  o	Answered theoretical questions related to Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames.
3.	Data Analysis and Insights:
  o	Identified the country with the oldest player.
  o	Determined the attribute with the lowest average value for goalkeepers.
  o	Analyzed the dataset to find the preferred position type with the most entries.
  o	Identified the highest-rated player from Portugal under the age of 25.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated:
  •	Python: Utilized Python for data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
  •	Pandas: Leveraged Pandas for DataFrame operations, filtering, and aggregation.
  •	SQL: Formulated and executed SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation.
  •	Data Visualization: (Optional) Created visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn to present key findings.

## Conclusion: 
This project showcases my ability to work with real-world datasets, perform detailed data analysis, and derive meaningful insights. 
It highlights my proficiency in Python, Pandas, and SQL, as well as my capability to communicate findings effectively.
